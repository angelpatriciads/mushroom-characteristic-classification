# Mushroom Characteristic Classification using Deep Learning

#### -- Project Status: Completed

## Project Objective
Create a deep neural network to perform the process classification of mushrooms characteristic and using hyperparameter tuning to get the best model. Then, do analysis on accuracy, precision, recall and, f1-score of the model and also determine the features that are strongly suspected of being related with toxics of a mushroom.

### Methods Used
* Deep Learning
* Neural Network

### Language
* Python

### Module
* Pandas
* Matplotlib
* Numpy
* Seaborn
* Keras
* Tensorflow
* Sklearn


## Step-by-step
1. Dataset analysis
2. Cleaning data
    * Checking missing values
    * Checking duplicates data
3. Data Visualization
4. Encoding
    * Data nominal : onehot encoding
    * Data binary : ordinal encoding
5. Sampling data
6. Feature Selection
    * Using Pearson Correlation
7. Data preparation
    * Train-test-val split with the proportion 7.5:1.25:1.25
8. Tuning hyperparameter
    * Best number of layer  : 3
    * Best number of neuron : 50
9. Build the model
10. Model evaluation
    * Precision : 0.99
    * Recall    : 0.99
    * F1-score  : 1.00
    * Accuracy  : 99%
